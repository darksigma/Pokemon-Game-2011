I built this simple emulation of the classic Pokemon game in Java as a project for a computer science class in 2011. It employs the GridWorld framework/API. 

To play game, run the Jar file in PokemonGameFinalBuild/ and click run. Then you can manipulate the character on the world grid using the arrow
keys.
